/*Explain whether the following program fragment is legal.
  std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;

The program fragment is not legal. The operator << is a member of std::cout, thus cannot be called without the object std::cout as each line is ening with semicolon. 
Prepend the expression with std::cout.
